# Python Theatre Kontrol (PyTK)
**A Python library for controlling ETC Eos lighting consoles via OSC.**

## Features
- Send OSC commands to a variety of consoles over TCP or UDP.
- Validate responses from the console to ensure correct communication.
- Support for multiple OSC framing options.
- Easy-to-use API for common commands.

## Roadmap
Please refer to markdown file [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the project roadmap and future plans.

## Console Support
PyTK is designed to be flexible and the goal of this project is to support as many varietys of consoles as possible. I myself will be starting with support for the Eos family of consoles, but I hope to expand to other brands in the future. Given the constantly evolving nature of the consoles that this software interfaces with, it is likely that support for new consoles will be added on an as-needed basis, but I am always open to suggestions and contributions.

## AI Assistance Policy
While I have and do continue to use AI tools to assist with the development of Python Theatre Kontrol, this project is by no means an AI-generated or vibe coded project. I am the sole maintainer and primary developer, and I take maintainability and support of my projects very seriously. I personally use AI tools to assist with problem solving, and creating of simple code snippets, especially for things that I'm not particularly familiar with, things like regex. However AI tools have not been used to generate large portions of this codebase. And I personally review or perfect nearly every line of code that I publish. I don't belive AI generated code to be a perfect solution, especially in the scope of maintainability, reliability and security. Should you choose to contribute to this project, I would kindly ask that you followa similar approach to the use of AI tools as I myself do, that it is a tool and not a crutch.
