# Eos Roadmap
This is where the roadmap for Eos family support can be found. Due to the scale of this project, it's important for me to plan and breakdown my development choices, and my priorities.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Basic Cue List TX/RX:
    - Interrogate the console for information about cue list counts, cue counts, and cue details.
    - Interrogate the console for information about active and pending cues, and handle those in the background with queues.
    - Record Cues to the active Cue list, with properties like labels and fade times.
    - Fire Cues on the active cue list.
    - GoTo_Cue on the active cue list.
- Basic Submaster TX/RX:
    - Interrogate the console for information regarding submaster properties, fader levels, etc.
    - Set submaster levels.
- Basic Preset and Pallete RX/TX:
    - Interrogate the console on information regarding recorded presets and palletes (Names, counts, fixture types, etc.)
